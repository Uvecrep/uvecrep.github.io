				I enjoy playing with videogames, doing coding projects, and tinkering with
				computer parts/hardware. My favorite animal is a housecat, but I appreciate all
				animals very much. I get a lot of joy out of planning something, and once it is
				complete having a finished and tangible product in my hands. I am studying
				computer science because I think that is is a broad field that is still devdloping, and
				I enjoy creating and making things. I also get excited at the ideas and creations out
				of some tech companies, among them the proposed plans from Neuralink I find 
				particularly interesting and exciting.
